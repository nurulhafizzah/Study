After lots of discussion, our project title is CyberCare(CC): A Smart Online Counseling Platform for Cyberbullying Victims. In short, our project is an online counseling platform, where users can connect to professional counselor online and ofline.


Summarization<br>
Me and my teammates had conduct a lot of discussion to makes this project successful. All of us play a pivotal role by giving ideas and opinion.
Here is some discription about our website. <br>

-Problem <br>
People who are suffering cyberbully often refuse to ask for help from counselors. This due to several problem :

1) Concern about personal information exposure. <br>
Due to cyberbullying, victims become more paranoid about what they share with others, especially counselors. They are concerned since some counselors record the counseling session. 

2) Scared of being judged. <br>
Cyberbullying may lower victims' confidence. Therefore, they tend to isolate themselves than meet people because they fear judgment. 

3) Limited access to counselors. <br>
Many victims thought that counselors only can be found at the hospital. Thus, most of them choose to pass it because they don't want to queue for the line and appointment.   

-Solution<br>
Online platform counselors are a need to help people with mental health issues expressing their feelings. With online platforms, the victims can overcome their trauma by slowly talking with their chosen counselor about their burden without meeting physically. However, if the users are ready enough to meet their counselor, a face-to-face counseling section is also provided.

-Prototype
The prototype of CyberCare(CC) was to visualize the design and functionality of the website. Google Sites, Jotform and Canva were used to create the website layout. The main features of the prototype include:  

1) AI-powered chat available 24/7 for immediate emotional support. 

2) Real counseling sessions with trained professional counsellors from selected institutions. Users can choose to receive support online via video call or face-to-face, depending on their preference. 

3) Counsellor selection where users can choose counsellors based on institution, name, education background, qualification, license and location. 

4) Calendar or booking system that allows users to schedule real counselling sessions according to the available slots.

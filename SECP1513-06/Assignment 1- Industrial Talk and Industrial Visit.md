Summarisation :
From this industrial talk, I learned how to become a good worker, especially for the project manager position. It taught me that good communication with teammates and customers will always result in a successful product.
Some of the content that i had learn are:
1) Top reason of project failure
   - Poor of preparation
   - Little communination at all level
   - Bad leadership
3) Crieteria of project manager
   - Daily stand up method
   - make mock up
   - sprint planning
5) Tips of application Development
   - Make a prototype ( To make both party understand clearly )
   - Communication ( To make the product reach customers expectation )
 
Improvement :
The Industrial Talk and Visit program operated smoothly. However, there are some improvements that can be made.
1) Improve the sound system
– During the talk, the microphone sound was a little too low, students at the back of the hall could not hear the content clearly.
2) Adjust the lighting
– The lighting was generally good during the talk. However, to improve it further, the lighting could be dimmed during the slide presentation to make the text clearer and sharper.

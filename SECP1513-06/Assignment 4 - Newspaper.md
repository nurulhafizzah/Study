- Summarization <br>
On a recent industry visit to Johor Port Berhad, students were given a comprehensive look into technical infrastructure that power's one of Malaysia's most vital logistics hubs.
The session included a keynote presentation delivered by En.Mohamad Taufiq Abdul Razak (IT Manager) and Tn Hj Badrul Hisham Abdul Halim (Head of Infrastructure).
The speaker highlighted how integrated IT systems are essential business drivers that manage large-scale data flows, ensure high-level network security, and maintain operational efficiency across the terminal.

- Improvement <br>
The industrial visit to Johor Port is so fun. I really hope we can spend much more time there. For future industrial visit, I hope we we can get the oppurtunity to get into the ship and watch 
the actual process of managing logistics hubs.

- Reflection <br>
This visit gave me a clearer example of how technologies can affect the world especially in port business. I also learned that the computer science field will be a high demand  job in the future as technologies continue to advance. This makes me feel proud and relieved as I will have a lot of job opportunities in the future.
